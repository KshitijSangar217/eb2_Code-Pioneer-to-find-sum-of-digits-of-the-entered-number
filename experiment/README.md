### Aim
To understand the concept of while Loop in C Programming Language by finding sum of digits of a number.

### Theory

In C different loops are used for controlling flow of program. For adding digits of number in the program while loop is used.The while loop is generally have condition and block of statements. In while loop the condition is checked and if given boolean condition is true,the block of statements will get executed. This will be repeated until condition becomes false. If the condition becomes false it will exit the loop and further execution of program is done.
In the program to calculate sum of digits, we have used while(number>0) loop with condition i.e. till number is greater than 0, then the code of block statements contains finding of remainder and addition of digits to "sum" variable. This block of statements will be excuted repeatedly till condition given in the while loop is true. 


<b>Pseudocode</b>
1. Declare three variables to store number, remainder, and sum and set all variables to 0.
2. Prompt message "Enter a number".
3. Take number input from user.
4. Repeat step 5 to 7 until number>0.
5. Compute remainder of number by modulo 10 operation.
6. Add remainder to sum.
7. Divide the number by 10.
8. Print the sum.

### Procedure

1. Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen. 
2. "START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.
3. Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed. Input box will appear infront of scanf statement when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button. 
4. After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum".Changes in variable values is shown by highlighting the borders of variable box.After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result in Sum variable.
