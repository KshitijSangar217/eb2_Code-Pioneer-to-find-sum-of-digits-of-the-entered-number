### Aim
To Understand the concept of while Loop in C Programming Language

### Theory
In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement

### Procedure
1. Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen. 
2. "START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.
3. Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed. Input box will appear infront of scanf statement when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button. 
4. After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result in Sum variable.

### Pre Test
1) While loop checks the condition and the loop keeps on running till the condition is true, it stops when the condition becomes false ____________.<br>
<b> a) True<br></b>
b) False<br>

2) Choose a right C Statement.<br>
a) Loops or Repetition block executes a group of statements repeatedly.<br>
b) Loop is usually executed as long as a condition is met.<br>
c) Loops usually take advantage of Loop Counter<br>
<b> d) All the above.</b><br>

3) Loops in C Language are implemented using.?<br>
a) While Block<br>
b) For Block<br>
c) Do While Block<br>
<b> d) All the above</b> <br>

4) Which loop is faster in C Language, for, while or Do While.? <br>
a) for<br>
b) while<br>
c) do while<br>
<b> d)  All work at same speed<br> </b>


### Post Test
Q 1. How many times while loop excutes? <br>
i=1 <br>
while i <= 4: <br>
print('repeat loop:' , i)<br>
i = i+1<br>
A. Loop Loop Loop Loop Loop

<b>B. Infinite Loop</b>

C. Loop Loop Loop

D. Prints Nothing


Q 2.int main() <br>
{ <br>
int a=25;<br>
while(a <= 27)<br>
{<br>
    printf("%d ", a);<br>
    a++;<br>
}<br>
return 0;<br>
}<br>
a. 25 25 25<br>
<b>b. 25 26 27<br></b>
c. 27 27 27<br>
d. No change in pattern is visible<br>
