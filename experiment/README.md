### Aim
To Understand the concept of while Loop in C Programming Language

### Theory
While loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression. The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true, the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. It is one of way which gives the learner a deep understanding of While loop and the Arithmetic operators.

<b>Pseudocode</b>
1. Declare three variables to store number, remainder, and sum and set all variables to 0.
2. Prompt message "Enter a number".
3. Take number input from user.
4. Repeat step 5 to 7 until number>0.
5. Compute remainder of number by modulo 10 operation.
6. Add remainder to sum.
7. Divide the number by 10.
8. Print the sum.

### Procedure
1. Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen. 
2. "START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.
3. Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed. Input box will appear infront of scanf statement when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button. 
4. After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result in Sum variable.
