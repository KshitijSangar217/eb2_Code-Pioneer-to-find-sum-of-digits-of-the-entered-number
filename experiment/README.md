### Aim
To Understand the concept of while Loop in C Programming Language

### Theory
In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement

### Procedure
1. Click on the button “START”. It takes to simulation screen. 
2. "START" button will changed to "Next" button,Program Code will appear in Code block and Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" with initialzed value to zero in right block will appear.
3. Click on "next" button for executing step by step instruction , user will get comments with every instruction executed. Input box will appear infront of scanf statement when instruction for input is executed , and "Next" button will convert to "SUBMIT" button. 
4. After submitting input, SUBMIT turns to Next and program will execute step by step showing changes of the values in Variable names "Number","Remainder","Sum" After excection it will show "Execution Completed" and result in Sum variable.

### Pre Test
1) Which of the following is not considered as a logical operator?<br>
a) &&<br>
b) !<br>
c) ||<br>
<b>d) //<br></b>

2) Which function is used to flush streams in C?<br>
<b>a) fflush<br></b>
b) flusher<br>
c) fempty<br>
d) fflusher<br>

3) Which function is used to input strings including spaces?<br>
a) scanf()<br>
<b>b) gets()<br></b>
c) printf()<br>
d) input()<br>

4) Which loop runs at least once regardless of condition?<br>
a) for<br>
b) while<br>
<b>c) do while<br> </b>
d) None of the above <br>

5) In the given statement, what does the “sample” indicate?<br> 
        int *sample[50];<br>
a) array of characters<br>
<b>b) array of int pointers<br></b>
c) function<br>
d) None of the above<br>

6) Which of the following is a conditional operator?<br>
<b>a) ? : <br></b>
b) &&<br>
b) *<br>
c) ^<br>

### Post Test
Q 1. How many times while loop excutes? <br>
i=1 <br>
while i <= 4: <br>
print('repeat loop:' , i)<br>
i = i+1<br>
A. Loop Loop Loop Loop Loop

<b>B. Infinite Loop</b>

C. Loop Loop Loop

D. Prints Nothing


Q 2.int main() <br>
{ <br>
int a=25;<br>
while(a <= 27)<br>
{<br>
    printf("%d ", a);<br>
    a++;<br>
}<br>
return 0;<br>
}<br>
a. 25 25 25<br>
<b>b. 25 26 27<br></b>
c. 27 27 27<br>
d. No change in pattern is visible<br>
