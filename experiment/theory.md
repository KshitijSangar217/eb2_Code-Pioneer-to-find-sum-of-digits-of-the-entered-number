While loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while construct consists of a block of code and a condition/expression. The condition/expression is evaluated, and if the condition/expression is true, the code within all of their following in the block is executed. This repeats until the condition/expression becomes false. Because the while loop checks the condition/expression before the block is executed, the control structure is often also known as a pre-test loop. It is one of way which gives the learner a deep understanding of While loop and the Arithmetic operators.

<b>Pseudocode</b>
1. Declare three variables to store number, remainder, and sum and set all variables to 0.
2. Prompt message "Enter a number".
3. Take number input from user.
4. Repeat step 5 to 7 until number>0.
5. Compute remainder of number by modulo 10 operation.
6. Add remainder to sum.
7. Divide the number by 10.
8. Print the sum.
