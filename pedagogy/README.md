#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept of application of modulo operater and loops. They do the experimentation based on the logic they can apply to the input, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the basic terminology used in computer programming. <br> Next line here. | Recall | Identify
2.| User will be able to: <br> Define and relate basic terminology for logic <br> Next line here. | Recall | Define
3.| User will be able to: <br> Describe how program will be excute <br> Next line here. | Understand | Describe
