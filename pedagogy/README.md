#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theroretical concept
The students know the concept of application of modulo operater and loops. They do the experimentation based on the logic they can apply to the input, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Describe flow  of program execution <br> | Understand | Describe
2.| User will be able to: <br>Apply concept of loop  <br>| Apply | Sketch

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Expository    <u> 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment


<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
Students will declare number of variables required for program.input and output statemetns are defined. They will convert logic of program into programming construct.Input value will be put in the formula which inturn runs in loop. Finally program will give the sum of digits of number entered when condition is met.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|<br> Describe flow  of program execution| <br> On the simulator , comments will be shown to students to understand the flow  |<br>
2.|<br> Apply concept of loop| <br>On the simulator screen, step by step excution of program will be shown| <br>

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on Simulation tab <br> | Simulator opens the experiment screen <br> | To open screen to perform experiment.
2.| User is asked to give input <br> | Simulator accepts input <br> | Input Displayed to user.
3.| student will press run button <br> | Simulator displayes values of Sum, Remainder and number <br> | Display of values.
4.| student will press next button <br> | simulator displays changing value for every next instruction click <br> | to get final result.
