#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theoretical concept
Reinforce theoretical concept means, re-registering concept learnt previously.The students have learnt the loops in the theory. So the simulator is showing how while loop is getting excuted when condition is true and what will happen when condition is false. So they are verifying the working of while loop.
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Interpret flow  of program execution <br> | Understand | Interpret
2.| User will be able to: <br>Make use of the concept of loop  <br>| Apply | Make use of

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Expository    <u> 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment


<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
Students will get to know declaration and initialization of variables . They will able to get  logic of program by sequential execution of instruction. How Input value will be put in the formula which inturn runs in loop. Finally program will give the sum of digits of number entered when condition is met.After understanding  the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-
1.|<br>Interpret flow  of program execution| <br> On the simulator , comments will be shown to students to understand the flow  |<br> What is .h stands for? <br>A. Binary file extension<br> <b>B. Header file extension</b> <br> C. Ascii file  extension<br> D. User Defined file | <br>
2.|<br> Make use of the concept of loop | <br>On the simulator screen, step by step excution of program will be shown| <br> When this while (x<100) will excute <br> <b>A. When x is less than one hundred</b> <br> B. When x is greater than one hundred<br>  C. When x is equal to one hundred<br>  D. While it wishes |<br>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on "START" button <br> | Simulator opens the experiment screen <br> | To open screen to perform experiment.
2.| Student will press "NEXT" Button <br> | Simulator executes the instructions step by step till the end of the program<br> | Introduce and simulate the changes in the code visually.
3.| Student will enter a Number in the text box appeared, and click on "Submit" button <br> | Simulator will take in the input number, reappear the "NEXT" button and constantly display the inputted value at the top.<br> | Reading the input value from the user.
4.| Student will click on "OK" button when the alert named "Simulation completed", pop-up on the screen.| Simulator will be resetted to the start. | To notify the student regarding completion of the simulation and to reset the simulator.
