#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theroretical concept
Reinforce theroretical concept mean re-registering concept learnt previously.The students have learnt the loops in the theory.So the simultor is showing how while loop is getting excuted when condition is true and what will happen when condition is false.So they are verifying the working of while loop.
#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Interpret flow  of program execution <br> | Understand | Interpret
2.| User will be able to: <br>Make use of the concept of loop  <br>| Apply | Make use of

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Expository    <u> 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment


<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
Students will get to know declaration and initialization of variables . They will able to get  logic of program by sequential execution of instruction. How Input value will be put in the formula which inturn runs in loop. Finally program will give the sum of digits of number entered when condition is met.After understanding  the experiment, student shall give answer to the questions asked.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.|<br>Interpret flow  of program execution| <br> On the simulator , comments will be shown to students to understand the flow  |<br> What is .h stands for? <br>A. Binary file extension<br> <b>B.Header file extension</b><br> C.Ascii file  extension<br> D.User Defined file | <br>
2.|<br> Make use of the concept of loop | <br>On the simulator screen, step by step excution of program will be shown| <br> When does the code block following while (x<100) execute?<br><b>A. When x is less than one hundred</b><br> B. When x is greater than one hundred<br>  C. When x is equal to one hundred<br>  D. While it wishes |<br>

#### 5. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on START Simulation tab <br> | Simulator opens the experiment screen <br> | To open screen to perform experiment.
2.| Student will press "Next" Button <br> | Simulator excutes Instructions step by step <br> | Introduction of code and accepting of input
3.| Student will press "Submit" button <br> | Simulator accepts input and excute while loop to give result<br> | Understanding of while loop execution.
