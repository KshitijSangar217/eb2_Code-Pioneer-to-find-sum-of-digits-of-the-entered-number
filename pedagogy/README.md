#### 1. Focus Area : Experimentation and Data Analysis
The students know the concept of application of modulo operater and loops. They do the experimentation based on the logic they can apply to the input, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Recall the basic terminology used in computer programming. <br>| Recall | Identify
2.| User will be able to: <br> Define and relate basic terminology to implement logic <br> | Recall | Define
3.| User will be able to: <br> Describe how program will be excute <br> | Understand | Describe
4.| User will be able to: <br> calculate sum of digit <br>| Apply | Calculate

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Expository    <u> 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment


<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
Students will declare number of variables required for program.input and output statemetns are defined. They will convert logic of program into programming construct.Input value will be put in the formula which inturn runs in loop. Finally program will give the sum of digits of number entered.

#### 4. Task & Assessment Questions:

Read the theory and comprehend the concepts related to the experiment. [LO1, LO2, LO3]
<br>

Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Task to be performed by <br> the student  in the simulator | Assessment Questions as per LO & Task
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| LO's as described in section 1 <br> Recall the basic terminology used in computer programming| <br> | On the simulator screen, student ask for input from user,Sum value is displayed initially 0 in the box.| LO's as described in section 1 <br> What is type of input value is need to be enterd | Type the task that <br> student will perform | 1 Question in detail <br> A. #### Integer <br> B. Float <br> C. Char <br> <b> D. string </b> <br> (mark correct option as bold text)

2.| LO's as described in section 1 <br> Define and relate basic terminology to implement logic| Type the task that <br> student will perform | On the simulator screen, 
   remainder will be shown after dividing the rightmost digit of a input number by 10, adding that number to sum so updating value of sum after every iteration
3.| LO's as described in section 1 <br> Describe how program will be excute| Type the task that <br> student will perform | On the simulator screen, student will show changes in values while loop is executing
4.| LO's as described in section 1 <br> calculate sum of digit to get final result| Type the task that <br> student will perform | On the simulator screen, final sum will be displyed
