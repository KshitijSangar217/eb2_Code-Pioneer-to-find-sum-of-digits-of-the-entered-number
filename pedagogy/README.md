#### 1. Focus Area : Reinforce theroretical concept
The students know the concept of application of modulo operater and loops. They will experiment  logic written in code by applying  input, trial and error and learn from it, finally analyzing results with standard value.

#### 2. Learning Objectives and Cognitive Level


Sr. No |	Learning Objective	| Cognitive Level | Action Verb
:--|:--|:--|:-:
1.| User will be able to: <br>Interpret flow  of program execution <br> | Understand | Interpret
2.| User will be able to: <br>Make use of the concept of loop  <br>| Apply | Make use of

#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  : Expository    <u> 
###### Assessment Method: Formative Assessment


<u> <b>Description: </b></u>
<br>
Students will get to know declaration and initialization of variables . They will able to get  logic of program by sequential execution of instruction. How Input value will be put in the formula which inturn runs in loop. Finally program will give the sum of digits of number entered when condition is met.

#### 4. Simulator Interactions:
<br>

Sr.No | What Students will do? |	What Simulator will do?	| Purpose of the task
:--|:--|:--|:--:
1.| Student will click on START Simulation tab <br> | Simulator opens the experiment screen <br> | To open screen to perform experiment.
2.| student will press Next Button <br> | Simulator excutes Instructions step by step <br> | Introduction of code and accepting of input
3.| student will press "Submit" button <br> | Simulator displayes values of Sum, Remainder and number with every instruction executed<br> | Understanding of while loop excution.
